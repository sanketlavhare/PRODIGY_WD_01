This setup gives you a basic yet functional interactive navigation menu that changes styles dynamically based on scrolling and hovering over menu items. Adjust styles and behaviors as needed for your specific requirements or design preferences

HTML Structure: Defines a fixed header (<header>) with a navigation menu (<nav id="navbar">) and content sections (<section>).

CSS Styling: Provides styles for the header, navigation menu, links, and responsive adjustments. Includes a .scrolled class for changing background color on scroll and an .active class for highlighting the current menu item.

JavaScript Interactivity:

Adds a .scrolled class to the header on scroll to change its background color.
Highlights the current menu item (<a> tag) based on the section currently in view using the scroll event listener
